    <h2>The Purpose</h2>
    <p>There is a reason that this website exists. It is because, this is a
    school project to help spread awareness to students that we need to keep
    our coastlines clean. However, there is an organisation out there in New
    Zealand known as Sustainable Coastlines.</p>

    <p>They are an organisation where they focus on cleaning coastlines.
    Therefore, building this website basically supports their cause.</p>

    <p>So I am giving students two options. You either support Sustainable
    Coastlines if you want oceans clean, or get on with your daily lives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contain">
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>In New Zealand, there is an organisation known as Sustainable Coastlines.
    This organisation is a registered New Zealand charity. More importantly, they
    are on a mission to keep coastlines and waterways safe from pollution.</p>

    <p>Therefore, they deliver coastal clean-up events, public awareness campaigns,
    educational programmes, and riparian planting projects. In addition, they work
    with local community groups, interns, volunteers, and ambassadors. They work
    with those people to enable them, to deliver those activities into their own
    communities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contain">
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>Sustainable Coastlines love coasts and oceans, they want them litter free.
    They clean up beaches and deliver education to prevent litter, especially
    single-use plastics.</p>

    <p>Rivers in New Zealand need our aid. As a result, they restore waterways by
    planting trees. Secondly, enable communities to scale-up local solutions.
    Finally, educate people on the issues concerning freshwater.</p>

    <p>Various people created the challenges we face, and it has become our
    responsibility to clean our coastlines. So they use behaviour-focused
    education, inspiring events and training to encourage people to take care
    of the places they love.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="contain">
    <h2>Programmes</h2>
    <p>In order to achive their vision, they provide three core programmes. They
    all directly invlove communities in positive outcomes for the waterways and
    coastlines they admire.</p>

    <p>Beach clean ups have been important to Sustainable Coastlines, since
    beginning. Plastic pollution however, is not solved simply by collecting it
    where it ends up. As a result, this program will provide education into
    the equation, delivering positive change in the everyday lives of people.</p>

    <p>Keeping waterways free of litter is the main aspect of healthy waters, yet
    is not the only solution. This program enables practical action - tree planting
    - and education on pollution in our inland lakes and rivers. The purpose is to
    ensure the health of our waterways before they flow the sea.</p>

    <h2>Final Words..</h2>
    <p>1. Conserve water, so excess runoff and wastewater will not flow into
    the ocean.</p>
    <p>2. Reduce pollutants by disposing herbicides, pesticides, and cleaning
    products properly.</p>
    <p>3. Reduce waste by cutting down what you throw away.</p>
    <p>4. Shop wisely. You can do this by bringing a reusable bag and choose
    sustainable seafood.</p>
    <p>5. Use fuel efficient vehicles, carpool, or ride a bike. That is how you
    reduce vehicle pollution.</p>
    <p>6. Use less energy so it does not overset your thermostat.</p>
    <p>7. Follow "catch and release" practices, keep more fish alive.</p>
    <p>8. Anchor in sandy areas far from coral and sea grasses. Adhere to "no
    wake" zones.</p>
    <p>9. Survival and healthy habitat go hand in hand. Must treat with care.</p>
    <p>10. Volunteer for cleanups hosted by Sustainable Coastlines. You can also
    get involved in protecting your watershed as well.</p>

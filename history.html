<h2>History</h2>
<p>For many decades, humans are not aware that they contaminate sources of
drinking water with raw sewage. So it had to diseases such as cholera and typhoid.
For example, water pollution had intensified during the Industrial Era.
This is a time where factories began releasing pollutants directly into
waterways.</p>

<p>However before 2008, Auckland in New Zealand is the reigion that has the most
polluted waterways. Even in recent years, Auckland is still considered to have
the most polluted waterways, despite continous efforts from sustainable
Coastlines to clean waterways. For example, 62 percent of rivers and lakes have
been graded poor by the Ministry for the Environment for swimming, and 0 percent
have been graded good.</p>

<p>Fortunately, an organisation known as Sustainable Coastlines have been hard
at work cleaning our coastlines. More importantly, it all began back in 2008.</p>

<h2>2008..</h2>
<p>Back in 2008, Sam Judd had been travelling with Kiwi buddies; James Bailey
and Zach Beard. They all had voluntered for the Galápagos National Park. Yet
they were all shocked to find uninhabited coasts spoiled with litter, they had
remvoved 1.6 tonnes within 8 days.</p>

<p>Despite a near-fatal tiger shark attack, Sam got right back to work with James
and Zack. They all motivated 300 locals to remove 7.5 tonnes of litter from the
remote San Cristóbal Island. Therefore, the trio pledged to continue their efforts
to back in the Land of the Long White Cloud. However, the idea for Sustainable
Coastlines had been born.</p>
</div>

<div class="briefs">
<h2>2009..</h2>
<p>2009, the year when Sustainable Coastlines had been launched. They had
launched their first signature event; a clean up of Great Barrier Island. Sam
had joined forces with James, Camden Howard along with a team of organisers
to bring together 700 volunteers from schools, the mainland, and the local
community for a massive clean up. It lasted over 2 days. However, they managed
to remove 2.8 tonnes of litter. As a result, the event garnered huge media
attention.</p>

<p>Bellow, there is a gallery displaying the images of Sustainable Coastlines
cleaning up Great Barrier during their first signature event.</p>
